The college bus tracking system is a system that helps the college students to keep track of their bus location so that the student’s don’t get delayed or arrive too early at their bus stop.
To overcome this increased waiting time and uncertainty of its arrival, we have come up with this system for our project.

Our proposed system is to find the location of the bus and let the users know about the location so that one can manage their time effectively and reach their stop just before the bus arrives or plan for alternate means of transport if they miss the bus or if they are running late.
Requirements/Features:
Our system will be mainly consisting of three entities:
1.	User
It is a student who go to their college via college bus. They have a source destination from where the driver of respective bus picks him up and drops off to and from college. The user can only keep track of its respective bus.
2.	Admin
He has some admin privileges of adding a college student to its respective bus, adding a driver to its respective bus, tracking of bus details, viewing route details, adding a new bus route.
3.	Driver
He is the driver of the college bus. He has the capability of viewing his bus details, adding some tracking details, keeping tracks of students for that bus.
